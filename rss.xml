            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Boomrrang - Professional Network for Educators</h1><p>This was a personal project developed to aid in the research for a dissertation project. The research was conducted to see if an online professional learning community could aid in isolation of rural school teachers.

I developed this web application to serve as that online learning community. This site was also used as the platform for the University of Oklahoma College of Education mentoring program.</p><img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/4e1e08e9-9094-4c5e-a8a6-299fc2a17bc0.png"></article>]]></description>
