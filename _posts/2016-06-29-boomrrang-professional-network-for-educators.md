  This was a personal project developed to aid in the research for a
  dissertation project. The research was conducted to see if an online
  professional learning community could aid in isolation of rural school
  teachers. One problem identified with rural school teachers is the lack of a
  professional community in which teachers can share ideas amongst each other. I
  developed this web application to serve as that online learning community.
  This site was also used as the platform for the University of Oklahoma College
  of Education mentoring program.

**Description**

This was a personal project developed to aid in the research for a dissertation project. The research was conducted to see if an online professional learning community could aid in isolation of rural school teachers. One problem identified with rural school teachers is the lack of a professional community in which teachers can share ideas amongst each other. I developed this web application to serve as that online learning community. This site was also used as the platform for the University of Oklahoma College of Education mentoring program.

**Technical**

The site is mainly a JavaScript front-end fed through a RESTful API. The back-end is built on top of the CodeIgniter PHP framework. This site integrates with various third party sites such as ZenCoder, YouTube, Vimeo, RackSpace CDN, etc.
